                   Installing OCamlClean on a Unix machine
                   ---------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

* The OCaml standard distribution


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Configure the system. From the top directory, do:

        ./configure

This generates the two configuration files "Makefile.conf" and "config.ml"
in the ./etc/ subdirectory.

The "configure" script accepts the following options:

-bindir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/bin)
        Directory where the binaries will be installed.

-mandir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/man/man1)
        Directory where the manual pages will be installed.

-prefix <dir>                   (default: /usr/local)
        Set bindir and mandir to <dir>/bin, <dir>/man/man1 respectively.


Examples:

  Standard installation in /usr/{bin,man} instead of /usr/local:
    ./configure -prefix /usr

  Installation in /usr, man pages in section "l":
    ./configure -bindir /usr/bin -mandir /usr/man/manl


2- From the top directory, do:

        make

This builds the ocamlclean program in directory: ./bin/.


3- You can now install the OCamlClean system. This will create the
following command (in the binary directory selected during
autoconfiguration):

        ocamlclean     an OCaml bytecode cleaner

From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make install

4- Installation is complete. Time to clean up. From the toplevel
directory, do:

        make clean


UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- If configuration files (./etc/Makefile.conf and ./etc/config.ml)
have been lost, run again ./configure from the top directory with the
same options as at step 1 of installation.

2- From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        make uninstall
