# Miranda

This is a clone of official miranda language

Target is to use it for undestanding lazy functionnal language compilation
and evaluation.

*Miranda* being small is a good target for this

## Notes
The orignal C source is old and quite ugly, with lots of extern not 
being in .h, and many declarations that should be static...

And indentation is quite strange, altogether it is not very readable.

## Branches

* *originalsrc* untouched sources from tar file
* *cleanup* cleaning C code
